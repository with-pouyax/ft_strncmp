# ft_strncmp

Welcome to the repository containing the `ft_strncmp` function, a custom implementation designed to mimic the behavior of the standard `strncmp` function found in the C programming language. This function compares up to `n` characters of two strings to determine if they are equal or which one is lexicographically greater.

## Overview

The `ft_strncmp` function is designed to perform a lexicographic comparison of two strings up to `n` characters or until a terminating null-byte is found. This function is particularly useful for comparing strings with a specified limit, offering more control over the comparison process.
